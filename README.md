SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains code for build a machine learning model for find SMS spam.

Purposely

The objective of this project are developing a model that can classify incoming SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). This can helps users filter out unwanted promotional messages and avoid potentially phishing attempts.

Dependencies

The project need several Python library such as pandas, numpy, nltk, sklearn, etc.

Data

The project assume you own a dataset of SMS messages labelled as spam or ham. These data can obtains from various online sources.

Usage

The project typically implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Looking at the provided code files for specific instructions on running the model training and prediction.

Here is a general outline of what the code might encompass:
Data Load and Preprocessing: This step contain loading the SMS dataset and doing any necessary cleaning and preprocessing tasks like removing punctuation, convert text to lowercase, and manage missing values.
Feature Engineer: This step mean creating features from the text data that can use by the machine learning model. It could involve techniques like TF-IDF or word embedment.
Model Train: The code will train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. Popular options for SMS spam detection involve Naive Bayes.
Model Evaluate: The code would evaluate the performance of the trained model on a held-out test set. This will provide insights into the model's precision and generality.
Predict: The code will enable you to input a new SMS message and prediction whether it is classified as spam or ham by the trained model.

Future Improvements

Here some potential areas for progressing development:
Explore more innovative machine learning models like deep learning techniques for possibly higher accuracy.
Implement the model into a mobile application or SMS filtering service for real-time spam detection.
Continuously updating the model with new data for enhancing its ability to detect evolving spam tactics.

Disclaimer

It's essential to recognize that spammers continuously adjusting their tactics. While this model may work, it might not be perfect and could requires ongoing maintenance and retraining to remain effective.
